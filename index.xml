      <description>Screen Watch Dog App I recently had the chance to share my experience with ScreenWatchDog, which was featured on ProductHunt. It was quite enlightening to see the amount of effort required to get recognition and attention. I learned that having a built-in community is a significant advantage when it comes to publishing your product on PH. It&amp;rsquo;s like receiving a flood of well-wishes and congratulations from people you know on your birthday.</description>

      <description>Screen Watch Dog App &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OR &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Download as Install Package &amp;nbsp You are probably wondering where are versions 1.12 and 1.13. Fasten your seatbelts I will tell you a story.
Once version 1.11 was out and we started testing with a small group of Beta testers we found out that eventually, the computer would go to sleep and monitoring would stop working. So most of the work in v 1.</description>
