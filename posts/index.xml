      <description>Screen Watch Dog App &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OR &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Download as Install Package You are probably wondering where are versions 1.12 and 1.13. Fasten your seatbelts I will tell you a story.
Once version 1.11 was out and we started testing with a small group of Beta testers we found out that eventually, the computer would go to sleep and monitoring would stop working. So most of the work in v 1.12 was done to add “No Sleep Mode” functionality.</description>
